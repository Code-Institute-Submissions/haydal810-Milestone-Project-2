#### Meeting the needs of the user stories (as described in the UX section of this README file)

#### As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate the site, regardless of device used, so I can find what I need efficiently.
The website is responsive on all devices, thanks to the Bootstrap 4 Grid incorporated in the HTML & CSS code. 

#### As a new visitor to the website, I want to find out about things to do in the area, so I can decide if it's worth visiting the area.
